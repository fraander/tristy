#  TODOs
- Remove groups feature (for now), since Swift Data is not optimized for sharing currently
- Ensure tags work correctly without lists yet
- Rethink lists feature so that lists become "Store" [user adds, auto add if needed] tags and "Priority" [this trip, next trip, eventually] tags
- Add "List Builder" screen to easily pull past items in (will need to update model to track past items)  
- Update text field for adding to have autocompletion and to prioritize reducing duplication (increasing db quality in the process)
- Add CloudKit sync
- Optimize MacOS and iPadOS versions following reliable sync
- Create easy insertion feature to easily add from a list of groceries on a recipe page somewhere (feature of List Builder?)
