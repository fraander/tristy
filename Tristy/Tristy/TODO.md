#  TODOs
- Add "List Builder" screen to easily pull past items in (will need to update model to track past items)  
- Update text field for adding to have autocompletion and to prioritize reducing duplication (increasing db quality in the process)
- Add CloudKit sync
- Optimize MacOS and iPadOS versions following reliable sync
- Create easy insertion feature to easily add from a list of groceries on a recipe page somewhere (feature of List Builder?)
